    <p>To start with <em><strong>TAFU</strong></em> is a short form of <em><strong>Together Aids Foundation Uganda.</strong></em>
    </p>

    <p>Together Aids Foundation Uganda (TAFU) is a charity whose mission is to prevent the spread of
      HIV/Aids, fight against stigma and also teach HIV/Aids victims on how to leave normally and health.
      Through our outreaches we are well convinced that our mission will be attained.

    <!-- My story -->
    <h3>My name is Mukibi Richard and this is my short story</h3>
    Having experienced anxiety, loneliness, sadness, stress up to the extent where I felt my life was
    unworthy and thought of even killing myself so that I couldn’t live anymore. Briefly I felt I wasn’t worthy
    to live because I couldn’t imagine myself living on ARV’s. I was only helped by the counselling I received
    at the hospital and since then I realized how important counselling is to HIV patients need. In 2020 I got
    a chance to volunteer at Makonge Health Centre III as a health counselor and since then I have known
    how much this volunteer work is so important in our communities. Last year we had a number of
    outreaches and I that’s when I got a vision and a calling of starting the Together aids Foundation (TAFU)
    </p>

    <p>

      Although I never wished to be on ARV’s, now I choose to help and
      support others through counselling and education. Let them
      learn from my mistakes and not be victims of ignorance.
      I call upon you friends of good will to stand with me and our
      foundation to eradicate the ignorance, save lives and avoid
      stigma. Any contribution that you may wish to send towards our
      Buvuma outreach is highly appreciated. Remember 1USD can
      purchase an HIV testing kit.

      contact information below.
